# Pokemon_Data_Analysis
I created this project to showcase what I can do with data. This is something that I am passionate about to a point where I want to do more in the future. I believe that I worked on it for 2 months, but I can clearly see myself working on it for more!

Here are some of the variables that are in the code

Stats in Pokemon:
 A pokemon has a unique set of stats that contribute to the Pokemon's identity. 
  Total: The accumulation of all the stats below
  HP: Also known as "Hit Points": The Health of the Pokemon 
  Attack: The physical attack move of the Pokemon
  Special Attack: The magic/ranged attack move from the Pokemon 
  Defense: How much can a Pokemon withstand from physical attacks
  Special Defense: How much can a Pokemon withstand from magic/ranged attacks
  Speed: How agile a Pokemon is. Often dictates which Pokemon can attack first
  
 Generation: Where the Pokemon is from. Generation and Region will be used interchangeably.
 
 Type 1 and Type 2: This is the attribute of the Pokemon. There are 18 types in the world of Pokemon. A Pokemon can have just one typing or two. 
 
 Legendary: This is a True/False statement that says if a Pokemon is a legendary Pokemon or not.
