# Pokemon_Data_Analysis
I created this project to showcase what I can do with data. This is something that I am passionate about to the point where I want to do more in the future. I believe that I worked on it for 2 months, but I can clearly see myself working on it for more!

## Objective

In this project, I wanted to see if I can predict if a one can predict a Legendary Pokemon based on its stats, and if there's a specialization in each Pokemon type. :
1. Getting the data via Kaggle, and loading it in Google Colab (so I can access it on multiple devices).
3. Creating various data frames in order to group them based on types and legendary in order to do Exploratory Data Analysis.
4. I then used statistical techniques such as ANOVA, K-Means clustering, and others to answer my questions about legendary prediction and specialization.
5. I later used different machine-learning techniques to predict a Pokemon's legendary status and ask other questions that interested me.




This dataset contains X rows and Y columns for the variables listed below. The following contains stats in Pokemon: A Pokemon has a unique set of stats that contribute to the Pokemon's identity. 

Variable  |Description |
